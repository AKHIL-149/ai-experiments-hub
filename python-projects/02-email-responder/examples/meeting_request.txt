Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to see if you'd be available for a meeting next Tuesday at 2 PM to discuss the Q1 project roadmap.

We have some exciting ideas we'd like to share and would love to get your input on the technical feasibility of implementing the new features.

Let me know if this time works for you, or if you'd prefer to schedule for later in the week.

Best regards,
Sarah
